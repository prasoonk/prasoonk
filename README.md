👋 Hi, I’m Prasoon Kumar and have been into the business of software over 24 years now (as of 2021).
- I'm a husband, dad to a teenager and energetic 9-year old.
- I work in enterprise architecture space.

👀 I’m interested in cloud-native architecture, data platform and AI/ML.

🌱 I’m currently learning SRE principles for Apache Kafka and its eco-system; devops for nosql like MongoDB, Cassandra; mcicroservices; modeling in graph databases and many more.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all of above and whatever else you bring on.
